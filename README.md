## Dependencies

This node suite has been designed to be as easy to install as possible.

‚úÖ **Zero external dependencies!**

You do not need to install any additional Python packages using `pip`. All functionalities rely either on Python's standard library or on components already included with ComfyUI. This means the installation is truly as simple as cloning the repository.

**Note: I am not a volunteer for training and to carry out professional workflows with these nodes.
